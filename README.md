# Hello World Python Application with Flask

A basic application developed with Flask that displays the message "Hi, I'm Sarahi. This is my Python project" on the web page.

## Description

This project is a simple web application built with Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The application displays a message on a webpage instead of in the console. It runs inside a Docker container to make deployment and execution easier in any environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10** or higher
- **Docker** (if you want to run the application inside a container)
- **Pip** (to install dependencies if running locally)
- **Text editor or IDE of your choice** (Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, etc.)

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** - Python web framework
- **Python 3.10**
- **Docker** (for containerized application)

## Installation and Running

```

### 2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Hello-Python-Project
```

### 3. Install dependencies:
If you're running the application locally, you'll need to install the dependencies using pip. Make sure you have a virtual environment active or install the dependencies globally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application locally:
To run the application locally, simply run the following command:

```bash
python project.py
